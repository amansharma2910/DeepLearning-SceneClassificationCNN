Whether it be the futuristic [Tesla Autopilot](http://www.tesla.com/autopilot) or your iOS or Android device's smart photo gallery that automatically segments your pictures using facial recognition and object detection, deep learning is everywhere. \n\nThe sheer power that deep learning unlocks for you in terms of what you can achieve via it, that rapid advancements in the fields of AI due to deep learning; this never fails to amaze me.\n\nThe aim of this article here is to introduce you to the magic of Deep Learning. We will see how to train a Deep Learning model (that uses the CNN algorithm) capable of recognizing the scene in an image.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n## Understanding the Problem Statement\n---\n\nFor this project, we will be working on the [Intel Image Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/puneet6060/intel-image-classification) dataset. \n\n\nThis is a multi-class classification problem where, given a picture, we want our model to classify it as one of the six possible scenes - buildings (0), forest (1), glacier (2), mountain (3), sea (4) or street (5).\n\nAs per the data source, each image is a 150 × 150 pixel, 3-channeled (RGB) image, with around 14k images in the training set and 3k images in the testing set.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n## Importing Project Dependencies\n---\n\nFirst, we will import all the necessary Python PyData modules. \n\n*One thing to be noted is that we are implementing the model using PyTorch.*","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import os \nimport torch  \nimport numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.metrics import f1_score \nfrom PIL import Image\n\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader, Dataset, random_split\nimport torchvision.models as models\nimport torchvision.transforms as transforms\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\nimport torch.nn as nn\nfrom torchvision.utils import make_grid\n\ntorch.manual_seed(5)\nnp.random.seed(5)\n\n%matplotlib inline","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n## Preparing the Dataset\n---\nNow comes the first tricky part. If you look at the dataset directory, you will observe that we don't have any CSV file or a directly labelled data to work with. Rather, the training and testing data directories are further divided into subdirectories for each possible outcome class. So, in order to be able to work with this data, we need to restructure the data into a format that we can work on; a format that we are used to working with, basically CSV files and pandas.DataFrame objects. Also, since we will be implementing our Deep Learning model using PyTorch, we need to convert the images into tensor objects.\n\nFrom a programmer's problem solving perspective, let us break down these problems-\n\n1. \n    * Formatting the unstructured dataset into structured CSV and dataframe objects \n    * Adding label to the data\n2. \n    * Converting the images into tensor objects \n    * Converting the dataframe into a PyTorch dataset\n    \n3.
