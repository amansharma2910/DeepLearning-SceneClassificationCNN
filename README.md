# Scene Classification Using CNN

In this project, originally hosted on Kaggle, I have worked on a Deep Learning model based on the powerful CNN algorithm, capable of detecting the scene in an input image. 

This is a multi-class classification problem where our model analyzes the input image and tries to classify the scene in the image as one of the six possible classes-
 * buildings: 0
 * mountain: 1 
 * street: 2
 * forest: 3 
 * sea: 4 
 * glacier: 5
 
 This is a complete project, where I have implemented different Deep Learning techniques such as **data normalization**, **data augmentation**, **batch normalization**, **weight-decay-prevention** and **learning rate scheduling**  along with different residual network (ResNet) architectures, comparing the model performance for each architecture.
